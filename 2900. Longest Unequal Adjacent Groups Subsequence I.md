# 🚀 [2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/)

## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given:
- A string array `words`
- A binary array `groups`, both of **length `n`**

Each `words[i]` is associated with `groups[i]`.

You must return the **longest alternating subsequence** of `words`, such that:
- For any two **consecutive elements** in the subsequence, their corresponding `groups` values differ (i.e., they alternate between `0` and `1` or vice versa).

> If multiple answers are possible, return **any one** of them.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]`  
**Output:**  
`["e", "b"]`

**Explanation:**  
- Possible alternating subsequences: `["e", "b"]` and `["a", "b"]`
- Both are of maximum length = 2.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,0,1,1]`  
**Output:**  
`["a", "b", "c"]`

**Explanation:**  
- Longest valid subsequence: `["a", "b", "c"]`
- Alternating pattern: `1 -> 0 -> 1`

---

## 💡 Approach

1. **Start from the first word** (always include it).
2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - At each index `i`, check if `groups[i] != groups[i - 1]`
   - If yes, **add `words[i]`** to the result.
3. This greedy method ensures you always extend the sequence when the group alternates.

## 👨‍💻 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> getLongestSubsequence(vector<string>& w, vector<int>& g) {
        vector<string> res = {w[0]};  // Always include the first word
        for (int i = 1; i < g.size(); ++i) {
            if (g[i] != g[i - 1]) {
                res.push_back(w[i]); // Include only if the group alternates
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
