# 🚀 [2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags/)

## 📜 Problem Statement

You have `k` bags and a list of marbles with weights given in the array `weights`. You need to distribute the marbles into `k` bags following these rules:

1. **No bag should be empty**.
2. **Marbles grouped in a bag must be consecutive in the original array**.
3. **The cost of a bag is computed as** `weights[i] + weights[j]`, where `i` and `j` are the first and last index in that bag.
4. **The total score** is the sum of all bag costs.

**Objective:**  
Find the difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** possible scores across all valid distributions.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
- Minimum score: `[1], [3,5,1] → (1+1) + (3+1) = 6`
- Maximum score: `[1,3], [5,1] → (1+3) + (5+1) = 10`
- Difference: `10 - 6 = 4`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`weights = [1, 3], k = 2`  
**Output:**  
`0`  
**Explanation:**  
- The only valid way is `[1], [3]`, which gives the same score for max and min.

## 💡 Approach

### **Key Observations**
1. **Only adjacent pairs matter:**  
   - Since all marbles between two indices must be in the same bag, the cost of a division depends on adjacent pairs.
2. **Finding the smallest and largest sums:**  
   - Compute **pair sums** (`weights[i] + weights[i+1]`).
   - Sort these sums.
   - The `k-1` **smallest** sums form the **minimum** score.
   - The `k-1` **largest** sums form the **maximum** score.

## 👨‍💻 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long putMarbles(vector<int>& weights, int k) {
        int n = weights.size();
        
        vector<int> pairSum(n-1, 0);
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++) {
            pairSum[i] = weights[i] + weights[i+1];
        }
        
        sort(pairSum.begin(), pairSum.end());
        long maxSum = 0;
        long minSum = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<k-1; i++) {
            minSum += pairSum[i];
            maxSum += pairSum[n-i-2];
        }
        
        return maxSum - minSum;
    }
};
