# 🚀 [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

## 📜 Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the **longest consecutive elements sequence**.

### Constraints:
- Your algorithm must run in **O(n)** time complexity.

---

### 🔍 Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, so its length is `4`.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`  
**Output:**  
`9`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, so its length is `9`.

## 💡 Approach

The problem can be solved efficiently in **O(n)** using a **HashSet**:

1. **Insert All Elements into a HashSet**  
   Use a `unordered_set` to store all elements from the array. This allows O(1) time complexity for lookups.

2. **Identify the Start of a Sequence**  
   A number is the start of a sequence if there is no number smaller than it (`num - 1`) in the set.

3. **Count the Length of Each Sequence**  
   Starting from the identified number, count consecutive numbers (`num + 1`) in the set to find the length of the sequence.

4. **Update the Longest Length**  
   Maintain a variable `longest` to store the maximum length of any sequence found.

## 👨‍💻 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        int longest = 1; // Stores the longest consecutive sequence length
        unordered_set<int> st(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Insert all elements into a HashSet

        // Iterate through the set
        for (int num : st) {
            // Check if the number is the start of a sequence
            if (st.find(num - 1) == st.end()) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int count = 1;

                // Count the consecutive numbers in the sequence
                while (st.find(currentNum + 1) != st.end()) {
                    currentNum += 1;
                    count += 1;
                }

                // Update the longest length if needed
                longest = max(longest, count);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
};
