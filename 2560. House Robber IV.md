# 🏠 [2560. House Robber IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/)

## 📜 Problem Statement

There are several **consecutive** houses along a street, each containing some **money**. A **robber** wants to steal from these houses, but **he refuses to steal from adjacent houses**.

The **capability** of the robber is the **maximum amount** of money he steals from a single house among all the houses he robs.

You are given:
- An **integer array** `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the **amount of money** in the `i-th` house.
- An **integer** `k`, which is the **minimum number of houses** the robber will steal from.

It is **guaranteed** that it is **always possible** to steal from at least `k` houses.

Return the **minimum capability** the robber needs to **steal at least `k` houses**.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2`  
**Output:**  
`5`  
**Explanation:**  
Possible ways to rob at least `2` houses:
- Rob houses at indices `[0, 2]` → **Capability** = `max(nums[0], nums[2]) = max(2, 5) = 5`
- Rob houses at indices `[0, 3]` → **Capability** = `max(nums[0], nums[3]) = max(2, 9) = 9`
- Rob houses at indices `[1, 3]` → **Capability** = `max(nums[1], nums[3]) = max(3, 9) = 9`

**Minimum capability** among all possibilities = `min(5, 9, 9) = 5`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
There are `7` ways to rob at least `2` houses. The optimal choice:
- Rob houses at indices `[0, 4]` → **Capability** = `max(nums[0], nums[4]) = max(2, 1) = 2`.

Thus, we return `2`.

## 💡 Approach

### **Key Observations**
1. The robber's **capability** is determined by the **most valuable** house they rob.
2. We need to **minimize** this value while ensuring **at least `k` houses** are robbed.
3. **Binary Search** on the possible **capability range** (`[min(nums), max(nums)]`):
   - **Check if it's possible** to rob `k` houses **without exceeding `mid` capability**.
   - Adjust search range accordingly.

## 👨‍💻 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums, int mid, int k) {
        int house = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if(nums[i] <= mid) {
                house++;
                i++; // Skip adjacent house
            }
        }
        return house >= k; // Can we rob at least k houses?
    }

    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int l = *min_element(begin(nums), end(nums));
        int r = *max_element(begin(nums), end(nums));
        int result = r;

        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2; // Capability

            if(isPossible(nums, mid, k)) {
                result = mid;
                r = mid - 1; // Try to minimize capability
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
