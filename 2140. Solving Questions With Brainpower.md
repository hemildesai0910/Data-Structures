# 🚀 [2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/)

## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions, where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].  
Each question can either be *solved* or *skipped*, with the following rules:

1. *Solving* question i earns points[i] but prevents you from solving the next brainpower[i] questions.
2. *Skipping* question i lets you move to the next question.

*Goal:*  
Find the maximum points you can earn by strategically solving or skipping questions.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
*Input:*  
questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]  
*Output:*  
5  
*Explanation:*  
- Solve question 0 → Earn 3 points, skip questions 1 & 2.
- Solve question 3 → Earn 2 points.
- *Total points = 3 + 2 = 5*.

---

### Example 2:
*Input:*  
questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]  
*Output:*  
7  
*Explanation:*  
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1 → Earn 2 points, skip 2 & 3.
- Solve question 4 → Earn 5 points.
- *Total points = 2 + 5 = 7*.

## 💡 Approach

### *Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)*
1. Define dp[i] as the **maximum points possible starting from question i**.
2. Iterate *backwards* (i = n-1 to 0) and update dp[i]:
   - *Skip the question:* dp[i+1]
   - *Solve the question:* questions[i][0] + dp[i + brainpower[i] + 1] (if within bounds)
   - *Take the maximum of both choices.*

## 👨‍💻 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        int n = questions.size();
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            long long skip = dp[i + 1];
            long long solve = questions[i][0];
            if (i + questions[i][1] + 1 < n) {
                solve += dp[i + questions[i][1] + 1];
            }
            dp[i] = max(skip, solve);
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};
